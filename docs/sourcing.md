## It's Alive!
This sourcing guide is a living, breathing document and should be viewed as such. The purpose of the sourcing guide is to help builders to locate parts as quickly and easily as possible. We understand that links go dead quite often as sellers pull and relist listings all the time. Please report any issues with seller links you find directly to us under the dead-links channel in our discord.

This is NOT currently an exhaustive list of components. We are working towards this, but this takes time. We have limited resources and this is certainly a WIP.
