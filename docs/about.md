# First Steps

The first step to getting started with this build is understanding the filename nomenclature. We have specifically encoded every filename with a set of identifiers to ensure you print everything properly and in the correct color. 
We all know aesthetics are more important than function! Right?

## Nomenclature Key

| Key         | Outcome                          |
| :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| `STR`       |      High strength profile  |
| `STD`       |  Standard profile |
| `SUP`       |     Enable Supports |
| `NOSUP`     |     Turn supports off |
| `AC/MAIN`   |      Denotes accent color or main color |
| `#X`        |     Quantity |

!!! info High Strength vs Standard Strength

    We recommend 2 Walls with 150% line width, 3 tops and bottoms with 0.20mm layer height, and 25% gyroid infill for our high strength parts. We are aware that old habits die hard and the Voron print specification is also acceptable, however we recommend trying ours as all parts were tested with these settings and not Voron specifications. Standard strength denotes 2-3 walls at standard line widths and enough tops, bottoms, and infill to not have any holes or pillowing. 

## Material Choice

We can not stress this enough; ASA is the material of choice for this machine. ABS is also just as acceptable however we have found ASA to be easier to print than ABS. Polymaker makes incredible ASA that has served us well across the duration of this project. Slightly pricier than others, it is absolutely worth the quality. If you are looking for a sightly more budget oriented option, flashforge makes decent ASA as well.

!!! danger Do not cut corners

    The above information is all to be followed to the letter. Do not risk damage to machine, property, or personal injury because you wanted to save a relatively insignificant amount of money by purchasing PLA, PETG, or not printing the parts at proper strength settings. Additionally, do not purchase white ASA or ABS from any brand. The pigment contains titanium dioxide which is known to weaken plastics noticeably. In conjunction with this, avoid eSun ABS+ for similar reasons. These will all come back to haunt you down the road and will significantly impact the longevity and performance of your machine.

    It is not worth the risk.
