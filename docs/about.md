| :---------: | :----------------------------------: |
| `STR`       |      High strength profile  |
| `STD`       |  Standard profile |
| `SUP`       |     Enable Supports |
| `NOSUP`     |     Turn supports off |
| `AC/MAIN`   |      Denotes accent color or main color |
| `#X`        |     Quantity |


### Key:

- STR = High strength profile; 3 walls @ 150% line width, 25% gyroid infill, 3 tops and bottoms, 0.4 nozzle is reccommended for proper fitment
- STD = Standard profile; print at your standard settings
- SUP = Enable Supports; we are doing our best to eliminate supports but are not quite there yet
- NOSUP = Turn supports off
- AC/MAIN = Denotes accent color or main color
- 0X = Quantity of that model

### Example: Beam_R_STR_NOSUP_MAIN_4X.stl

This would denote a part that requires the high stength print profile and doesn't require support. Additionally, it is the main filament color of your choosing and you need to print four of them to satisfy this items requirement.
