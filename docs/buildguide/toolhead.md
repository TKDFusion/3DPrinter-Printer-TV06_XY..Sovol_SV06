## What's new?
The SV06 is known for it's superior extrusion quality and compact size. We decided to reuse the stock SV06 toolhead with some modified parts to ensure that we brought this pedigree of perfection over to our machine. Namely, a sever cooling upgrade was due for these increased speeds. Part cooling has been 100% overhauled to accomodate these higher speeds.

## Modding Guide
This toolhead is highly capable and many will find that upgrading the toolhead is not neccesary, but we know how much modding matters so we are directly supporting this. The toolhead STEP file can be located below for ease of use in CAD
