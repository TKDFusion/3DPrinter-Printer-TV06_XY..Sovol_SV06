## What's new?
The SV06 is known for it's superior extrusion quality and compact size. We decided to reuse the stock SV06 toolhead with some modified parts to ensure that we brought this pedigree of perfection over to our machine. Namely, a sever cooling upgrade was due for these increased speeds. Part cooling has been 100% overhauled to accomodate these higher speeds.
