# TV06 CoreXY Conversion

The Terminal Velocity 06 project is a conversion project aimed at bringing high speeds to SV06 3D printer owners. Originally developed as a branch of the ProosaXY, the TV06 has taken on a fully unique form now as it moves into the Beta testing stage. The goal of the machine is simple; 10k acceleration and 250mm/s print speeds at quality.

The TV06 was designed by Dustmuffins and Ghoste of the TV06 Discord Server. We welcome all to our community and invite you to join using the discord icon at the bottom of this page.

???+ warning Irreversible Alterations

     While the TV06 Project aims to incorporate as many parts from the original SV06 line of machines, there are some compromises that must be made. There will be some components that will need to be cut to properly execute this modification. Namely, rods and leadscrews will be cut. The frame is also comprised of new metal mostly and you will need to be comfortable operating a metal saw. If you are not, please contact our help-desk channel in the discord and someone will assist you.

## A Thank you to our predecessor 

The TV06 project would not be where it is today without the initial time investments of the [ProosaXY](https://www.printables.com/model/518614-proosaxy-mk3s-to-corexy-conversion). We would like to thank Chip for their incredible work and inspiring us to make this project. 

Thank You

## Let's get started!

We're just as excited as you to get this build underway. We thank you for showing interest in our hardwork and without further ado, Let's Go!

### Key:

- STR = High strength profile; 3 walls @ 150% line width, 25% gyroid infill, 3 tops and bottoms, 0.4 nozzle is reccommended for proper fitment
- STD = Standard profile; print at your standard settings
- SUP = Enable Supports; we are doing our best to eliminate supports but are not quite there yet
- NOSUP = Turn supports off
- AC/MAIN = Denotes accent color or main color
- 0X = Quantity of that model

### Example: Beam_R_STR_NOSUP_MAIN_4X.stl

This would denote a part that requires the high stength print profile and doesn't require support. Additionally, it is the main filament color of your choosing and you need to print four of them to satisfy this items requirement.
