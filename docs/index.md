# TV06 CoreXY Conversion

The Terminal Velocity 06 project is a conversion project aimed at bringing high speeds to SV06 3D printer owners. Originally developed as a branch of the ProosaXY, the TV06 has taken on a fully unique form now as it moves into the Beta testing stage. The goal of the machine is simple; 10k acceleration and 250mm/s print speeds at quality.

The TV06 was designed by Dustmuffins and Ghoste of the TV06 Discord Server. We welcome all to our community and invite you to join using the discord icon at the bottom of this page.

???+ warning "Irreversible Alterations"

     The TV06 Project seeks to integrate numerous components from the original SV06 machine line, but certain compromises are unavoidable. Specifically, some elements, such as rods and leadscrews, will be cut during the modification process. The frame predominantly consists of new metal, and proficiency in using a metal saw is essential. If you lack experience in operating a metal saw, please reach out to our help-desk channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xVtU45zTrk), and someone will help you out.

## A thank you to our predecessor 

The TV06 project would not be where it is today without the initial time investments of the [ProosaXY](https://www.printables.com/model/518614-proosaxy-mk3s-to-corexy-conversion). We would like to thank Chip for their incredible work and inspiring us to make this project. 

Thank You
