# TV06 CoreXY Conversion

## A CoreXY conversion for the Sovol SV06 designed by Dustmuffins and Ghoste

The Terminal Velocity 06 project is a conversion project aimed at bringing high speeds to SV06 3D printer owners. Originally developed as a branch of the ProosaXY, the TV06 has taken on a fully unique form now as it moves into the Beta testing stage. The goal of the machine is simple; 10k acceleration and 250mm/s print speeds at quality.

### Key:

- STR = High strength profile; 3 walls @ 150% line width, 25% gyroid infill, 3 tops and bottoms, 0.4 nozzle is reccommended for proper fitment
- STD = Standard profile; print at your standard settings
- SUP = Enable Supports; we are doing our best to eliminate supports but are not quite there yet
- NOSUP = Turn supports off
- AC/MAIN = Denotes accent color or main color
- 0X = Quantity of that model

### Example: Beam_R_STR_NOSUP_MAIN_4X.stl

This would denote a part that requires the high stength print profile and doesn't require support. Additionally, it is the main filament color of your choosing and you need to print four of them to satisfy this items requirement.
