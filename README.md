# TV06
## A CoreXY conversion for the Sovol SV06 designed by Terminal Velocity

The TV06 is a conversion project aimed at bringing high speeds to SV06 3D printer owners. Originally developed as a branch of the ProosaXY, the TV06 has taken on a fully unique form now as it moves into full release. The goal of the machine is simple; 10k acceleration and 250mm/s print speeds at quality. While we have blown past these speeds now, we are working to improve kinematics to achieve even higher goals.

## File Nomenclature: A warning!
All of the files enclosed in the repo are titled very specifically! You MUST follow the instructions in each items title to achieve proper results. Failing to do so is likely to result in lots of failed prints and broken parts. 

### Key:
- STR = High strength profile; 3 walls @ 150% line width, 25% gyroid infill, 3 tops and bottoms, 0.4 nozzle is reccommended for proper fitment
- STD = Standard profile; print at your standard settings
- SUP = Enable Supports; we are doing our best to eliminate supports but are not quite there yet 
- NOSUP = Turn supports off
- AC/MAIN = Denotes accent color or main color
- 0X = Quantity of that model

### Example: Beam_R_STR_NOSUP_MAIN_4X.stl
This would denote a part that requires the high stength print profile and doesn't require support. Additionally, it is the main filament color of your choosing and you need to print four of them to satisfy this items requirement.
